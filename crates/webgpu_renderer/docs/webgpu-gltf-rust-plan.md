# Plan: WebGPU + glTF Renderer in Rust

*Moved here from BeschleunigerBallett's `docs/` under decision D6, which gave
this repository the WebGPU renderer's code **and** its documentation. Paths
below are relative to this repository (the crate is `crates/webgpu_renderer`)
unless they name another one.*

*Historical planning document, kept for the record — current per-feature
status lives in [webgpu-renderer-roadmap.md](webgpu-renderer-roadmap.md).*

Status: **milestones 1–5 implemented** (2026-07-18) as
`crates/webgpu_renderer`
(`kataglyphis_webgpu_renderer`): wgpu context (wgpu 27 then; the crate is on
wgpu 29 now) with headless + windowed
paths, resize/Outdated/Lost-safe surface lifecycle (attachment sizes derive
from the *acquired* frame texture, never the window), glTF loader
(positions/normals/UVs/indices, node transforms, base-color materials, flat
normal synthesis), forward pass with a directional light, orbit camera, a
`viewer` example (`cargo run -p kataglyphis_webgpu_renderer --example viewer
[model.gltf]`), and headless golden tests against a bundled generated
`tests/assets/cube.gltf` (structural pixel assertions in sRGB space).
Milestone 3 (2026-07-18): sRGB base-color textures with a white fallback
(glTF images decoded to RGBA8; a checkered `cube_textured.gltf` golden test
proves sampling), HDR Rgba16Float offscreen target, and an ACES tonemap
fullscreen pass (`render/tonemap.rs`) used by both the viewer and headless
readback. Follow-up noted: honor glTF sampler filters/wrap modes (currently
always linear/repeat), mipmaps.
Milestone 4 (2026-07-18): directional shadow mapping — depth-only pass from
the light's POV into a 2048² Depth32Float map (uniforms-only bind group: the
full group samples the map the pass writes), orthographic light frustum
fitted to the scene AABB, 3x3 PCF with slope-scaled bias in the forward
pass; golden test `shadow_darkens_plane_under_cube` over a generated
`cube_on_plane.gltf`.
Milestone 5 (2026-07-18): wasm32/WebGPU browser demo — cdylib +
wasm-bindgen entry (`src/wasm_demo.rs`) rendering the embedded shadow scene
in Chrome; verified locally (build wasm32 + `wasm-bindgen --target web`,
serve `crates/webgpu_renderer/web/`). Hard-won lessons: winit does not size
the canvas backing store (explicitly set it or the surface renders at ~1x1),
and Chrome's WGSL validator rejects `textureSampleCompare` in non-uniform
control flow — use `textureSampleCompareLevel` (an invalid module silently
voids the whole submit: pure black canvas, no page-visible error). The
crate's tests run in CI via the Linux workflow. Public hosting (the demo is
live on the docs site) and the Milestone 6 parity extras (egui overlay,
skybox, animations) are **done** — shipped 2026-07-18 per the roadmap.
**The full follow-on feature roadmap lives in
[webgpu-renderer-roadmap.md](webgpu-renderer-roadmap.md).**

## Why wgpu

`wgpu` is the de-facto Rust WebGPU implementation (used by Firefox and Bevy). One
codebase runs native (Vulkan on Windows/Linux — including the RX 9070 XT — plus
Metal/DX12) and in the browser via WASM against the WebGPU API. This complements
the C++ Vulkan engine: same scenes, portable renderer, reachable from the web.

## Dependencies (all pure Rust, workspace-pinned)

| Crate | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `wgpu` | WebGPU implementation |
| `winit` | window + input (native and WASM) |
| `gltf` | glTF 2.0 parsing (+ `import()` for buffers/images) |
| `glam` | linear algebra (mirrors GLM usage in the C++ engine) |
| `image` | PNG/JPEG texture decoding |
| `bytemuck` | safe casting of vertex/uniform data |
| `pollster` | block-on for native async adapter/device requests |
| `egui` + `egui-wgpu` (later) | overlay UI, mirroring the ImGui overlay |

## Milestones

1. **Triangle + surface lifecycle** — context creation, swapchain config,
   resize/suboptimal handling done correctly from day one (the C++ engine's
   resize path was this project's only real bug — port the lesson, not the bug:
   reconfigure the surface on `SurfaceError::Outdated/Lost`, never mid-frame).
   Headless `wgpu` test asserting a rendered triangle's pixels (golden test).
2. **glTF meshes + camera** — load positions/normals/UVs/indices, node
   transforms, depth buffer, fly camera. Golden test: render a bundled small
   asset (e.g. Khronos `Box.gltf`) headless and compare against a reference.
3. **PBR materials + tonemapping** — base color/metallic-roughness/normal maps,
   sRGB handling, HDR offscreen target + tonemap pass. Start with
   `KHR_materials_` core; skip extensions until needed.
4. **Lights + shadows** — directional light with a single shadow map first
   (cascades later, mirroring `CascadedShadowMap` in C++ only if needed).
5. **WASM target** — `wasm32-unknown-unknown` build of the viewer example,
   deployed as a static page; verifies the "web" half of WebGPU.
6. **Parity extras** (optional): skybox, egui overlay with the same toggles as
   the ImGui GUI (renderer mode switches), animation (`gltf` animations).

Each milestone lands with: headless golden-image test in CI (Linux lavapipe/
llvmpipe software adapter — no GPU runner needed), `cargo clippy` clean,
`cargo deny` clean (license check for new deps).

## Testing strategy

- `wgpu` supports headless rendering: create a device without a surface, render
  to a texture, read back, compare. This is the render-mode-coverage lesson from
  the C++ side applied from the start: every selectable pipeline path gets a
  frame-producing test, not just a bring-up test.
- Keep reference images small (64×64) and compare with a tolerance to absorb
  driver differences.

## Assets: can you use a Colosseum asset?

Short answer: **yes, if the specific asset's license allows it — check per
asset, and attribute.**

- Photogrammetry scans of the Colosseum on Sketchfab/Fab are typically
  **CC-BY 4.0** (usable, requires attribution in README/credits) or
  **CC-BY-NC** (usable only if the project stays non-commercial). A few are
  CC0 (no strings attached). The *building itself* is millennia out of any
  copyright; what is licensed is the particular scan/model you download.
- Do not commit multi-hundred-MB scans into git — put big assets in a
  `Resources/` download step or Git LFS, and keep a `LICENSES-ASSETS.md` entry
  (BeschleunigerBallett already has `docs/LICENSES-README.md` for this).
- For CI golden tests use tiny Khronos sample assets
  (github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Assets, mostly CC0/CC-BY) — e.g. `Box`,
  `DamagedHelmet` — and keep the Colosseum scan as a local/manual showcase
  asset. A million-triangle photogrammetry mesh will also want milestone 3+
  (mipmapped textures) and possibly meshoptimizer-style decimation first.

## Integration back into this repo

Not required initially — the crate lives and builds in the Rust workspace. If
desired later: a `RUST_WEBGPU` CMake option could build the viewer via
corrosion like the existing `oxidant` bridge, but the
faster path is `cargo run --example viewer` during development.
