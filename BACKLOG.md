# Backlog

Consumed by the ANTfrastructure agentic loop (`shared/agentic-loop/`) when this
repo adopts it. The file was previously zero bytes, which reads as "the
protocol exists and the backlog is empty" — it was neither.

## Protocol

- `- [ ]` actionable — the planner may pick it up
- `- [b]` blocked — skipped, and excluded from the pending count, so a
  backlog containing only blocked items still lets the planner run again
- `- [x]` completed — pruned on sight; the history lives in git

## Open

- [b] Drop the vendored `third_party/egui-winit-0.36.2` and its
      `[patch.crates-io]` entry once egui 0.37 (or any release carrying
      emilk/egui#8516) is on crates.io, then move the egui family to it.
      Blocked on that release. Steps: `third_party/egui-winit-0.36.2/PATCHED.md`.
      Re-checked 2026-10-10: crates.io's newest `egui` and `egui-winit` are still 0.36.2.

- [b] Instanced normals shade differently from the equivalent node transform.
      `a_non_uniform_instance_scale_shades_like_the_same_node_scale` fails with
      987 differing pixels against a threshold of 40; confirmed pre-existing and
      deterministic. Blocked here: `src/shaders/*.wgsl` are generated artifacts
      and the `forward.slang` source lives in the C++ engine repo.
      Reproduced byte-for-byte on the image's lavapipe (2026-09-29), where the
      Linux lanes now run the golden suite with `KATAGLYPHIS_REQUIRE_GPU=1`;
      the test is `#[ignore]`d for that, so drop the attribute with the fix.
- [b] Ship the .slang sources with crates/webgpu_renderer, or add a
      slang -> wgsl step, so "there is no .slang file in this repo" stops
      being true. src/shaders/*.wgsl are checked-in GENERATED artifacts whose
      source is the C++ engine's forward.slang; hand-editing the WGSL
      desynchronises it, which is why the instanced-normal bug above cannot be
      fixed here. Blocked on deciding who compiles tex_quad.slang.

## Not adopted yet

The loop itself — config, runner wrappers, `scripts/agentic-loop/` — is not set
up. Copy-and-edit templates live in ANTfrastructure's
`shared/agentic-loop/templates/`; a consumer supplies this file, a config JSON,
thin runner wrappers, and optionally per-engine system prompts.
