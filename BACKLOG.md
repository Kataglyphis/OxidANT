# Backlog

For the ANTfrastructure agentic loop (`shared/agentic-loop/`), once this repo adopts it
(see *Not adopted yet*). The file was once zero bytes, which read as "the protocol exists
and the backlog is empty"; it was neither.

## Protocol

- `- [ ]` actionable — the planner may pick it up
- `- [b]` blocked — skipped, and excluded from the pending count, so a
  backlog containing only blocked items still lets the planner run again
- `- [x]` completed — pruned on sight; the history lives in git

## Open

- [b] Drop the vendored `third_party/egui-winit-0.36.2` and its
      `[patch.crates-io]` entry once egui 0.37 (or any release carrying
      emilk/egui#8516) is on crates.io, then move the egui family to it.
      Blocked on that release. Steps: `third_party/egui-winit-0.36.2/PATCHED.md`.
      Re-checked 2026-10-12: crates.io's newest `egui` and `egui-winit` are still 0.36.2, published 2026-09-08 (emilk/egui#8516 merged 2026-09-07, unreleased).

- [ ] **Diagnose the intermittent headless GPU-test SIGSEGV** (M). A full default-parallel
      workspace run at `38b1c597` crashed in the `occlusion` test binary after 7/11 cases
      (SIGSEGV 11, exit 101). The same ELF then passed default and serial runs and five
      further default repeats; source CI on `920ca1b7` passed. The crash remains unexplained.
      Next: capture the GPU backend/driver and all-thread stack or core, distinguish test
      resource lifetime from a driver fault, then add a regression for the proven cause.
      Do not serialize all tests or call it fixed solely because CI is green.

- [b] **Accept DNNL on amd64 once `:latest` ships oneDNN** (S). The chain ORT's
      `libonnxruntime_providers_dnnl.so` needs `libdnnl.so.3`, which the image lacks, so
      `KATAGLYPHIS_ORT_DEVICE=dnnl` is `ProviderUnavailable` on amd64 too. Blocked on hub
      BACKLOG CON191 (an image chain). Then `cpu_accelerators.rs` and `check-backend-parity.sh`
      require DNNL to run and match the CPU provider on amd64; nothing here changes.

## Recorded probes

- **llguidance accepts the hub tiny model's tokenizer** (GenAI 0.17.0 in `:latest`, index
  `7d4d4129`, amd64). `GeneratorParams.set_guidance("json_schema", ...)` on the tiny model decodes
  `abc` under
  `{"type":"object","properties":{"a":{"type":"string","maxLength":3}},"required":["a"],"additionalProperties":false,"x-guidance":{"whitespace_flexible":false}}`
  to the ids `[123, 34, 97, 34, 58, 34, 35, 36, 37, 34, 125, 256]`, `{"a":"#$%"}` then the end
  token 256. A schema that allows whitespace makes the successor rule loop on `\t\n` until the
  budget ends, so the schema test keeps the tight form. No SmolLM2-135M fallback is needed for
  schema tests; SmolLM2-135M runs the ModelANT contract (`crates/text/tests/contract.rs`).
  Sampling at temperature 1 over the full vocabulary gives seed 1 a different 24-token answer
  from seeds 2 to 4. The Windows chain builds GenAI without llguidance, where the generator
  refuses a schema as `TextError::JsonSchemaUnsupported`.

## Not adopted yet

The loop itself (config, runner wrappers, `scripts/agentic-loop/`) is not set up.
Copy-and-edit templates live in ANTfrastructure's `shared/agentic-loop/templates/`; a
consumer supplies this file, a config JSON, thin runner wrappers, and optionally
per-engine system prompts.
