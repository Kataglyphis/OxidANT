# kataglyphis_webgpu_renderer is excluded HERE ONLY, and only because of the
# container image -- not because its tests are broken.
#
# Any test binary of that crate links wgpu, and wgpu's `gles` backend makes the
# executable import opengl32.dll at load time. Windows Server Core does not ship
# opengl32.dll, so the process dies with 0xc0000135 (STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND)
# before main() ever runs -- there is no runtime switch that avoids it, because
# the import is resolved by the loader. Letting it run just turns the whole
# `cargo test --workspace` into a crash with no test results at all.
#
# We keep the `gles` feature deliberately: it is the OpenGL fallback for
# machines without Vulkan/DX12. These tests are meant to run on a desktop
# Windows host, where opengl32.dll exists:
#
#   cargo test -p kataglyphis_webgpu_renderer --locked
#
# Revisit if the base image ever gains opengl32.dll, or if wgpu stops importing
# it eagerly.
